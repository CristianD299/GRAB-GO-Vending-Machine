🥤 C++ Vending Machine — University Assignment
This repository contains my C++ Vending Machine program created for my university Utility App assignment. The project demonstrates core programming concepts such as arrays, loops, conditional logic, input validation, and user interaction. The application runs entirely in the console and allows users to insert money, select items using codes, receive change, and make multiple purchases.

📌 Features
Core Requirements
- Console‑based menu of drinks and snacks
- Item selection using codes (e.g., 01, 02)
- Money input and validation
- Automatic change calculation
- Dispensing messages
- Clear comments explaining key operations
Additional Features
- Stock system: Each item starts with a limited quantity and can run out
- Multiple purchases: Users can buy more than one item using remaining balance
- Dynamic menu that updates stock levels after each purchase

📂 Project Structure

 └── Utility App/
       └── main.cpp


The main.cpp file contains the full source code for the vending machine.

▶ How to Run the Program
- Download the repository
- Open the project in any C++ IDE or compiler (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, g++)
- Compile the program
- Run the executable in the console
Example using g++:
g++ main.cpp -o vending
./vending



🎯 Learning Outcomes
Through this project I gained experience with:
- Managing structured data using arrays
- Implementing input validation
- Building interactive console applications
- Using loops and conditionals to control program flow
- Designing simple features like stock tracking and multi‑purchase logic
